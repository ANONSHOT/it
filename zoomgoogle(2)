regular analog phone line. Essentially, it converts the voice signals into digital signals, 
which are then transmitted over the internet. during meetings on Zoom and Google 
Meet. The use of VOIP technology ensures that both platforms can provide high quality 
audio transmission, resulting in efficient and effective communication regardless of the 
participants' geographical locations.
